<div class="about">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Following my studies (DUT Biological Engineering, Bachelor and Master in Computer Science, specialization in
        Bioinformatics), I decided to enter the world of work by creating my bioinformatics services company BILMS
        (Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Software, Maintenance, Services), in order to provide biology research
        laboratories with an external service, putting at my disposal my know-how and my expertise acquired throughout
        my studies.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the perspectives of each changes, that's why I considered a less administrative job,
        more focused on my technical skills. With this in mind, I gladly put my skills at Synap System, an open
        source solutions consulting company, for nearly a year and a half. Then came a mission to Acretion to
        participate in the development of an intelligent social network dedicated to sharing values, via an innovative
        strategy.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am working at Sogeti, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cap Gemini S.A., leader in IT services and
        local engineering, specializing in application and infrastructure management.</p>
