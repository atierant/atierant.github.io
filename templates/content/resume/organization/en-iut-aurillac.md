# Description

Specialized training in the domains of computer science, analysis tools and modeling dedicated to biology in order to:
- Produce and analyze biological data in genomics and post-genomics (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc.) and extract relevant information from data from high-throughput techniques (DNA biochips, microarrays, etc.).
- Manage bioinformatics resources (bioinformatics hardware and software, internet, intranet, online databases, etc.).
- Develop software/applications under the direction of a biology executive or researcher (custom bioinformatics applications, software chaining, Human-Machine interface, etc.).
- Organize and communicate: the assistant engineer participates in team work, exchanges scientific and technical information.
