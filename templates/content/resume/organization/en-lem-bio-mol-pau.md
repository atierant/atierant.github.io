    IPREM (Institute of Analytical Sciences and Physical Chemistry for the Environment and Materials) is a CNRS / UPPA Joint Research Unit (UMR 5254).
    IPREM brings together more than 200 people who are interested in the development of fundamental knowledge in physico-chemistry, analytical chemistry and microbiology, in relation to applications concerning the structure of living organisms, the management of the environment and the functional properties of different classes of materials.
    Its s are based around analytical strategies, modeling, physico-chemical approaches, detailed studies of structures and reactivity, development, characterization and implementation at different scales. They make it possible to display an original state in the domain of applications in many industrial sectors both nationally and internationally.
    IPREM, whose building was built in 2007 within the Helioparc technology park, has various branches on the Basque coast in Anglet, at IBEAS on the UPPA campus and in Mont de Marsan.
