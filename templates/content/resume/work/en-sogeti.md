# Technical expertise

I master design, development and strategy of software engineering tools and web frameworks oriented,
devops industrialization, risk management, monitoring and audits, and know how to argue my choices in a defined application context.

I designed a database architecture, defined and modeled the information, repositories and strategic data of the Airbus Helicopter company via a POC.
I was able to define with the client the most suitable model according to the company organizations roles and responsibilities.

I carried the control of the tests, both unitary and functional within a solution developed for CELR
(implementation of conditioned tests to the different user profiles), as well as automated end-to-end tests,
by supervising the RobotFramework achievements of the test team for a full coverage of requested functionalities.
I also participated in the implementation of these within the client's infrastructure.

# Project Management

I contributed to the launch activities on several projects. I have led technical teams on several occasions, bringing them know-how, skills, hindsight and autonomy.
I used, trained and governed the human resources made available on the projects in which I participated to
on the one hand the success of these projects, on the other hand the increase in skills and the qualification of these resources.
I knew how to take advantage of the human and material resources on our projects to achieve our objectives, via different team management, made up of P.O., developers from different backgrounds and levels, testers, of all ages.
I was able to set strategic technical objectives, define and explain to the teams the means and methods of implementing these means for a satisfactory result.

I participated fully in the implementation and the end-to-end realization of a project for La Poste representing industrial postage,
by supervising the technical team of the project.

I supervised a junior within the realization of a POC for the company Airbus Helicopter.

I was able to manage the activity of the technical teams (development and testing, up to 8 people), within a project for CELR, with a particular management for advanced software architecture concepts (DDD, CQRS, TDD, test strategies).

#  Agility

During my missions, I had the opportunity to approach several methodologies in agility (scrum, kanban, RAD),
and actively participate in the technical supervision of the compliance of these methodologies: supervision of ceremonies,
provision of tools for estimates (planning poker) and planning (sprint planning), ticketing (backlogs),
technical refinements in accordance with the customer thanks to strong communication with the latter, definition of done from a technical point of view,
continuous integrations/deployments, adaptation to projects via continuous improvement.
All the methodologies applied to have enabled the success of the projects in which I have actively participated by adapting them
on the fly to a customer context and providing them with the necessary elements for rapid and effective feedback.
