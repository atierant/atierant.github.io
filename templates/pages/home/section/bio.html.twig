                    Following my studies (DUT Biological Engineering, Bachelor and Master in Computer Science,
                    specialization in
                    Bioinformatics), I decided to enter the world of work by creating my bioinformatics services
                    company BILMS
                    (Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Software, Maintenance, Services), in order to provide biology
                    research
                    laboratories with an external service, putting at my disposal my know-how and my expertise
                    acquired
                    throughout
                    my studies.</p>

                    Sometimes the perspectives of each changes, that's why I considered a less administrative job,
                    more focused on my technical skills. With this in mind, I gladly put my skills at Synap System,
                    an open
                    source solutions consulting company, for nearly a year and a half. Then came a mission to
                    Acretion to
                    participate in the development of an intelligent social network dedicated to sharing values, via
                    an
                    innovative
                    strategy.</p>

                    The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my
                    work, but you
                    can also view my (somewhat outdated) <a href="/resume">resume</a>.
